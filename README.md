## Abstract

In the context of the Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem, our objective is to identify optimal or near-optimal paths for multiple agents operating within a sys-tem. Agents inside the system have respective start posi-tions and destinations. Most previous work on solving this problem concentrate on the case that each agent at run-time only holds a single start position and its unique destination. However, in many real-life cases, agents of-ten consistently move within the system and hand a queue of tasks through the time.
		In this paper, we present the solution for MAPF problems with Layovers with improved Conflict-based search (CBS) algorithm. CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not transform the problem into a single 'joint agent' model. At the high level, a search is conducted on a Con-flict Tree (CT), a tree structure derived from conflicts be-tween individual agents. Each node within the CT repre-sents a set of motion constraints for the agents. At the low level, rapid single-agent searches are executed to ful-fill the constraints imposed by the high-level CT nodes. In our approach, we retain the foundational logic of the CBS algorithm but introduce several new steps after an agent reaches its initial destination. First, we clarify the optimal path for an agent to its destination, then create a new agent at this endpoint and assign it a wait time equal to the travel time of the preceding agent. Subsequently, we reapply the CBS algorithm to determine the optimal path for the new agent. This modification simplifies the continuous Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem into a singular, extensive MAPF challenge. We assessed the viability of our enhancement by modifying an open-source CBS program. We have established several test cases to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution, though its optimality remains to be proven.

## Introduction   

The Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem is a corner-stone challenge in the fields of robotics, automated traffic systems, and logistics, where the goal is to coordinate multiple agents moving from specific start points to desig-nated destinations within a system. In our case, we studied the implementation of MAPF solver in warehouse man-agement. In automated warehouses, robots must move goods from storage locations to packing stations. Studying the MAPF problem helps in planning routes for multiple robots simultaneously to avoid collisions, minimize travel time, and increase the throughput of the warehouse.
	Traditionally, the focus has been on scenarios where each agent possesses a single starting position and a unique des-tination in one around. However, this approach does not re-flect many real-world applications where agents must han-dle multiple tasks and navigate through successive destina-tions over time. Recognizing the limitations of existing approaches, this paper introduces an enhancement to the well-established Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm, addresses the complexities of continuous multi-agent navi-gation with tasks in queue. Unlike conventional methods, our modified CBS algorithm merges the concept of layo-vers, allowing agents to keep going to the next destina-tions on their queueing task list. This adaptation helps manage the increased complexity of continuous task man-agement of a unified, extensive MAPF problem.
	The core of our methodology is still the CBS algorithm, and the fundamental concept behind the CBS algorithm is to grow a set of constraints and find paths that are con-sistent with these constraints. Should conflicts arise, ren-dering these paths invalid, the issues are rectified by intro-ducing additional constraints. CBS operates on two dis-tinct levels: at the high level, it detects conflicts and im-poses new constraints, while at the low level, it seeks paths for individual agents that comply with these updated constraints. By reintroducing the CBS post an agentâ€™s ini-tial task completion and creating new operational parame-ters for subsequent tasks, our approach promises a more dynamic and scalable solution to MAPF problems. 
	This paper evaluates the effectiveness of these enhance-ments through modifications and sets up several test cases. While early results show that our modified algorithm works, we need to do more research to verify its optimali-ty.
